## IDEAS

Post ANY ideas you have in any area of the data cleaning, preprocessing, predicting etc.


### Cleaning
1. Standardise area metrics (seems all are sq feet anyway, need to double check)
2. Grouping Categorical features with too many unique values based on similarity or response (many ways to do this ~ experimental)
3. Dummy variables for categorical features
4. 

### Feature Engineering
1. 

### Preprocessing
1. PCA (waaaaaay too many features)
2. 

### Models
1. Regression Models (Obviously) - test them all! haha
2. Ensemble?
3. See which variables perform best in all models and use the features each model likes - use variables with strong linear relationships with linear models eg. OLS
4. 

### Validations/Optimsation/Scoring
1. Grid Search (find best parameters)
2. SSE / R^2
3.
